## Introduction

TypeScript has gained significant popularity among developers due to its ability to catch type-related errors during development, providing better tooling support, and making code easier to maintain. This repository aims to serve as a central hub for TypeScript enthusiasts to learn and explore the language, from fundamental concepts to advanced techniques.

## Getting Started

To get started with TypeScript, you'll need to have Node.js and TypeScript installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. **Install Node.js**: If you don't have Node.js installed, download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org

2. **Install TypeScript**: After installing Node.js, open your terminal and run the following command to install TypeScript globally: `npm install -g typescript`

3. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command: `git clone https://github.com/eduardorezaghi/typescript-studies.git`

4. **Explore the Content**: Now you're ready to explore the various studies, examples, and resources in this repository.
